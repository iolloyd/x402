## Coinbase Developer Platform Configuration

### Overview

The CDP integration enables two critical features:
1. **Payment Facilitation**: Verifies and settles X402 USDC payments on Base network
2. **Onramp Integration**: Allows users to purchase USDC with credit/debit cards

### Step 1: Create API Keys

API keys are required for payment verification and session token generation.

1. **Navigate to API Keys**:
   - Log in to https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com
   - Click on "API Keys" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create API Key"

2. **Configure API Key**:
   - Name: `x402-wallet-screening-production`
   - Permissions: Select the following:
     - `wallet:read` (for payment verification)
     - `wallet:transactions:read` (for transaction validation)
   - Click "Create"

3. **Save Your Credentials**:
   ```
   CDP_API_KEY_ID=organizations/{org-id}/apiKeys/{key-id}
   CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
   [Your private key will be displayed here]
   -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
   ```

   **IMPORTANT**:
   - The private key is only shown ONCE
   - Copy it immediately to a secure location
   - Never commit these credentials to version control

### Step 2: Get Client Key for Onramp

The client key enables the Coinbase onramp widget in the payment UI.

1. **Navigate to Onramp Settings**:
   - In the CDP portal, go to "Onramp" or "Products"
   - Click "Create Onramp Integration"

2. **Configure Onramp**:
   - Application Name: `X402 Wallet Screening`
   - Destination Network: `Base`
   - Default Asset: `USDC`
   - Redirect URL: Your production domain (e.g., `https://wallet-screening.x402.org`)

3. **Copy Client Key**:
   ```
   CDP_CLIENT_KEY=your-client-key-here
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Payment Recipient Address

This is YOUR wallet address where you'll receive USDC payments.

**Requirements**:
- Must be a valid Ethereum/Base address (0x-prefixed)
- Must be accessible on Base mainnet
- Recommended: Use a hardware wallet or secure custodial service
- Can be the same address on both networks (Ethereum addresses work on Base)

**Example**:
```
PAYMENT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

**Where to Get an Address**:
- Coinbase Wallet: https://www.coinbase.com/wallet
- MetaMask: https://metamask.io
- Hardware wallet: Ledger or Trezor

**Important Considerations**:
- This address will receive all USDC payments from API users
- Ensure you have secure access to this wallet
- Consider using a multi-sig wallet for additional security
- Test with a small amount first before going live

## Upstash Redis Setup

### Step 1: Create Redis Database

1. **Log in to Upstash**:
   - Go to https://console.upstash.com
   - Click "Create Database"

2. **Configure Database**:
   - Name: `x402-wallet-screening-prod`
   - Type: `Regional` (cheaper) or `Global` (lower latency worldwide)
   - Region: Choose closest to your Vercel deployment region
   - Eviction: `noeviction` (important for data integrity)
   - TLS: `Enabled` (required)

3. **Create Database**:
   - Click "Create"
   - Wait for provisioning (usually < 30 seconds)

### Step 2: Get Connection Credentials

1. **Navigate to Database Details**:
   - Click on your newly created database
   - Scroll to "REST API" section

2. **Copy Credentials**:
   ```
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis-instance.upstash.io
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=AXj...your-token-here
   ```

3. **Test Connection** (optional):
   ```bash
   curl https://your-redis-instance.upstash.io/get/test \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer AXj...your-token-here"
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Redis for Production

**Memory Settings**:
- Minimum: 256 MB (handles ~100K addresses)
- Recommended: 512 MB (handles ~500K addresses with room for growth)
- The free tier (256 MB) is sufficient for initial deployment

**TTL Configuration**:
The application automatically sets appropriate TTLs:
- OFAC dataset: 25 hours (refreshed daily)
- Screening results (clean): 1 hour
- Screening results (sanctioned): 24 hours

### Option 1: Local Initialization (Recommended)

**Best for**: Initial setup, testing data flow

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/iolloyd/code/x402
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Local Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Upstash credentials
   ```

3. **Run Seed Script**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/seed-redis.ts
   ```

4. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   Starting Redis seed process...
   Fetching OFAC data from GitHub...
   Fetched data for 2 chains
   Storing 450 addresses for chain: ethereum
   Storing 450 addresses for chain: base

   âœ… Redis seed completed successfully!
   Total addresses stored: 900
   Chains: ethereum, base
   ```

5. **Verify Data**:
   ```bash
   # Test with a known sanctioned address

## X402 Bazaar Listing

### How Bazaar Discovery Works

The x402 Bazaar is a decentralized directory that AI agents use to discover available x402 services. Your API is automatically discoverable through the x402 middleware configuration.

### What Makes Your Service Discoverable

Your service is made discoverable through the `middleware.ts` configuration:

```typescript
'/api/screen/:chain/:address': {
  price: '$0.005',
  network: 'base',
  config: {
    discoverable: true,  // This flag enables Bazaar listing
    description: 'Screen cryptocurrency addresses...',
    outputSchema: { /* Full JSON Schema */ }
  }
}
```

### Service Metadata Exposed to Bazaar

When `discoverable: true` is set, the following information is automatically exposed:

1. **Endpoint Information**:
   - URL pattern: `/api/screen/:chain/:address`
   - HTTP method: GET
   - Price: $0.005 per request
   - Network: Base mainnet

2. **Description**:
   - Service purpose and capabilities
   - Input parameter descriptions
   - Expected use cases

3. **Input Schema**:
   - Path parameters: `chain` (ethereum|base) and `address` (0x-prefixed hex)
   - No body or query parameters required

4. **Output Schema**:
   - Complete JSON Schema of the response
   - All fields documented with types and descriptions
   - Required vs optional fields specified

5. **Payment Details**:
   - Supported payment scheme (x402-stablecoin)
   - Payment asset (USDC)
   - Payment network (Base)
   - Recipient address

### How AI Agents Discover Your Service

1. **Automatic Indexing**:
   - The x402 Bazaar crawler periodically scans deployed x402 services
   - It looks for services with `discoverable: true`
   - Metadata is extracted from your middleware configuration

2. **Service Registration**:
   - No manual registration required
   - Your service appears in Bazaar within 24-48 hours of deployment
   - Updates are picked up automatically when you redeploy

3. **Agent Discovery Process**:
   ```
   AI Agent needs wallet screening
     â†“
   Queries x402 Bazaar for "sanctions" or "OFAC"
     â†“
   Discovers your service with full schema
     â†“
   Generates x402 payment
     â†“
   Calls your API with payment header
     â†“
   Receives screening results
   ```

### Verifying Your Bazaar Listing

1. **Check Service Status**:
   - Visit the x402 Bazaar (URL will be provided by x402 team)
   - Search for "wallet screening" or "OFAC"
   - Verify your service appears with correct metadata

2. **Test Discovery Endpoint** (if available):
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/.well-known/x402-service.json
   ```

3. **Monitor Discoverability**:
   - Check Vercel logs for requests from Bazaar crawler
   - User-Agent typically contains "x402" or "bazaar"

### Expected Indexing Timeline

- **Initial Deployment**: 24-48 hours for first indexing
- **Updates**: 4-24 hours for metadata changes to propagate
- **Removal**: If you set `discoverable: false`, delisting occurs in 24-48 hours

### Optimizing Your Bazaar Presence

1. **Description Quality**:
   - Be specific about what your service does
   - Include key terms AI agents might search for
   - Mention supported chains and data sources

2. **Schema Completeness**:
   - Fully document all response fields
   - Include examples in descriptions when helpful
   - Mark optional fields correctly

3. **Service Reliability**:
   - Maintain high uptime (>99%)
   - Keep response times low (<500ms p95)
   - Monitor for errors and fix quickly

### Troubleshooting Bazaar Listing

**Service Not Appearing**:
- Verify `discoverable: true` is set in middleware.ts
- Confirm deployment succeeded on Vercel
- Check that payment recipient address is valid
- Wait full 48 hours before escalating

**Incorrect Metadata**:
- Update middleware.ts configuration
- Deploy changes to Vercel
- Wait 4-24 hours for re-indexing
- Clear may take longer if cached

**Service Marked as Unavailable**:
- Check health endpoint is responding
- Verify payment validation is working
- Review Vercel logs for errors
- Test end-to-end payment flow

## Testing the X402 Payment Flow

### Prerequisites for Testing

Before testing payments:
- [ ] Service deployed to Vercel
- [ ] CDP credentials configured
- [ ] Payment recipient address set
- [ ] OFAC data initialized in Redis
- [ ] You have a wallet with USDC on Base mainnet

### Test 1: Payment Wall Display

Test that unpaid requests show the payment UI.

1. **Make Request Without Payment**:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
   ```

2. **Expected Response**:
   - Status: `402 Payment Required`
   - Headers include: `X-Payment-Required: true`
   - Body contains payment requirements
   - If accessed via browser, displays payment UI with onramp option

3. **Verify Payment Requirements**:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Payment required",
     "code": "PAYMENT_REQUIRED",
     "payment_details": {
       "paymentRequirements": [{
         "scheme": "exact",
         "network": "base",
         "maxAmountRequired": "5000",
         "resource": "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen",
         "description": "Screen cryptocurrency addresses against OFAC sanctions lists",
         "mimeType": "application/json",
         "payTo": "0x...",
         "maxTimeoutSeconds": 300,
         "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
       }]
     }
   }
   ```

### Test 2: Onramp Integration

Test that users without USDC can purchase it.

1. **Access Payment Wall in Browser**:
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
   ```

2. **Verify Onramp Widget**:
   - Payment wall should display
   - "Buy USDC" button should be visible
   - Clicking button opens Coinbase onramp
   - Onramp shows correct amount ($0.005 + fees)
   - Destination network is Base
   - Asset is USDC

3. **Complete Onramp Flow** (optional, involves real money):
   - Click "Buy USDC"
   - Follow Coinbase prompts
   - Purchase USDC (minimum purchase may apply)
   - Wait for delivery to your wallet

### Test 3: X402 Payment with Valid Wallet

Test the full payment flow with an x402-compatible wallet.

**Prerequisites**:
- X402-compatible wallet (e.g., Coinbase Wallet with x402 support)
- At least 0.01 USDC on Base mainnet

1. **Using X402 CLI** (if available):
   ```bash
   x402 pay \
     --url https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 \
     --network base
   ```

2. **Using X402 SDK**:
   ```typescript
   import { createX402Payment } from '@coinbase/x402';

   const payment = await createX402Payment({
     amount: '5000', // 0.005 USDC in base units (6 decimals)
     recipient: '0x...', // Your recipient address
     network: 'base',
     asset: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913' // USDC on Base
   });

   const response = await fetch(
     'https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
     {
       headers: {
         'X-Payment': payment.toBase64()
       }
     }
   );

   const result = await response.json();
   console.log(result);
   ```

3. **Expected Response**:
   - Status: `200 OK`
   - Body contains screening results
   - Payment is verified and settled
   - Your recipient address receives USDC

### Test 4: Verify Payment Receipt

Confirm that payments are actually received.

1. **Check Recipient Balance**:
   ```bash
   # Using a block explorer
   https://basescan.org/address/0xYOUR_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS

   # Or using curl to check USDC balance
   curl https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-KEY \
     -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "method": "eth_call",
       "params": [{
         "to": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
         "data": "0x70a08231000000000000000000000000YOUR_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS"
       }, "latest"],
       "id": 1
     }'
   ```

2. **Verify Transaction**:
   - Check that USDC amount matches price per check
   - Confirm sender matches the payer in payment payload
   - Verify timestamp is recent

### Test 5: End-to-End Screening Flow

Test the complete screening workflow with payment.

1. **Test Clean Address**:
   ```bash
   # Use x402 client to make paid request
   x402 pay --url https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
   ```

   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "address": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
     "chain": "ethereum",
     "sanctioned": false,
     "risk_level": "clear",
     "flags": [],
     "checked_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z",
     "sources": ["ofac_github"],
     "cache_hit": false
   }
   ```

2. **Test Sanctioned Address**:
   ```bash
   # Known OFAC sanctioned address
   x402 pay --url https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x8589427373D6D84E98730D7795D8f6f8731FDA16
   ```

   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "address": "0x8589427373D6D84E98730D7795D8f6f8731FDA16",
     "chain": "ethereum",
     "sanctioned": true,
     "risk_level": "high",
     "flags": ["ofac_sdn_list"],
     "checked_at": "2025-10-01T10:30:00Z",
     "sources": ["ofac_github"],
     "details": {
       "list": "OFAC SDN",
       "entity_name": "Sanctioned Entity"
     },
     "cache_hit": false
   }
   ```

3. **Test Caching**:
   - Make the same request twice
   - Second request should return `"cache_hit": true`
   - Response should be faster (<100ms)

### Test 6: Rate Limiting

Verify rate limits are working correctly.

1. **Test Free Tier Limit**:
   ```bash
   # Make 11 requests without payment (limit is 10)
   for i in {1..11}; do
     curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
     echo "\n"
   done
   ```

   Expected:
   - First 10 requests: 402 Payment Required
   - 11th request: 429 Too Many Requests

2. **Check Rate Limit Headers**:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
   ```

   Headers should include:
   ```
   X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
   X-RateLimit-Remaining: 9
   X-RateLimit-Reset: 2025-10-01T11:00:00Z
   ```

### Test 7: Error Handling

Test that errors are handled gracefully.

1. **Invalid Chain**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/solana/0x1234...
   ```

   Expected: `400 Bad Request` with error message

2. **Invalid Address**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/invalid
   ```

   Expected: `400 Bad Request` with error message

3. **Invalid Payment**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/screen/ethereum/0x1234... \
     -H "X-Payment: invalid-base64"
   ```

   Expected: `402 Payment Required` (invalid payment ignored)

### Common Testing Issues

**Issue**: Payment not verified
- Check CDP API credentials are correct
- Verify payment recipient address matches
- Confirm USDC contract address is correct for network
- Check Vercel logs for validation errors

**Issue**: Onramp not loading
- Verify CDP_CLIENT_KEY is set

### OFAC Data Updates

Data is automatically updated daily via GitHub Actions.

**Verify Updates**:
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
```

Check `ofac_data: true` in response.

**Manual Update**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/data/sync-ofac \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OFAC_SYNC_API_KEY"
```

**Troubleshooting Failed Updates**:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify secrets are set correctly
3. Test sync endpoint manually
4. Check Redis capacity
5. Verify OFAC GitHub repo is accessible

### Handling Payment Failures

**Common Causes**:
